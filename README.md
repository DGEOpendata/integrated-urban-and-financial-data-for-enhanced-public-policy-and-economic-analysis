## Integrated Urban and Financial Data Analysis

### Overview
This project aims to integrate public transportation usage data with financial market indices to provide a comprehensive view of urban and economic dynamics. The integrated dataset can be used for advanced analysis and policy-making.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Installation
To run the example code, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install the required libraries using pip:
bash
pip install pandas matplotlib


### Datasets
- **Public_Transportation_Usage_Statistics_2023.csv**: Contains transportation usage data.
- **Indices Summary - Mar 2022 - Nov 2025.xlsx**: Contains financial market indices data.

### Implementation
1. **Load the datasets**: Use `pandas` to load and preprocess the datasets.
2. **Merge the datasets**: Merge the datasets on the Date column to align the data for analysis.
3. **Analyze correlation**: Calculate the correlation between transportation usage and market index values.
4. **Visualize the data**: Plot the transportation usage and financial market index to visualize potential correlations.

### Usage
- Adjust the file paths in the code to point to your local copies of the datasets.
- Run the script to perform the analysis and visualize the data.

### Conclusion
The integration of transportation and financial data provides valuable insights into the interplay between urban mobility and economic performance. This approach can enhance decision-making processes for urban planners and financial analysts.
